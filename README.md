# NOT YET FUNCTIONAL OR COMPLETE
- this is a WIP
- code will not compile without warnings

## Using your own words
- crossyword does not yet support custom files, but you can edit `words.txt` to add your own words
- place each new word on a new line, and seperate the word and clue with a period (.)
